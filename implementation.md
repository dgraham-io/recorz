# Implementation Log

## 2026-03-06 - Boot Image Metadata
- Added image-level evolution metadata to the QEMU MVP `RCZI` boot image: a feature bitmap plus an FNV-1a checksum.
- Updated the target image loader to reject unknown feature flags and verify the checksum before handing control to the program and seed loaders.
- Extended the lowering tests to validate the new image header fields and checksum behavior.
- Verified with `PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v` and `make -C platform/qemu-riscv64 clean all`.

## 2026-03-06 - Boot Image Inspector
- Added a host-side `RCZI` inspector in `tools/inspect_qemu_riscv_mvp_image.py` so the generated boot image can be decoded without running QEMU.
- Wired the inspector into `make -C platform/qemu-riscv64 inspect-image` for fast inspection of the generated demo image.
- Added focused tests for successful inspection and checksum-failure rejection.
- Verified with `PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v`, `make -C platform/qemu-riscv64 clean all`, and `make -C platform/qemu-riscv64 inspect-image`.

## 2026-03-06 - Boot Image Profile
- Added a fixed `RV64MVP1` profile identifier to the `RCZI` boot image header so incompatible images can be rejected before section loading.
- Updated the target image loader and the host-side inspector to enforce that profile match.
- Extended the image manifest and inspector tests to cover the new profile field and mismatch rejection.
- Verified with `PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v`, `make -C platform/qemu-riscv64 clean all`, and `make -C platform/qemu-riscv64 inspect-image`.

## 2026-03-06 - Boot Entry Metadata
- Added a dedicated `entry` section to the `RCZI` image that describes the current top-level boot contract: a zero-argument do-it targeting the program section.
- Updated the target image loader to validate that entry metadata before it touches the program or seed loaders.
- Extended the host-side inspector to display the entry contract and reject malformed entry metadata.
- Extended the manifest and inspector tests to cover the new entry section and malformed-entry rejection.
- Verified with `PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v`, `make -C platform/qemu-riscv64 clean all`, and `make -C platform/qemu-riscv64 inspect-image`.

## 2026-03-06 - Seed Binding Tables
- Replaced the fixed seed-header slots for globals, roots, and glyph offsets with explicit seed binding tables and a glyph object-index table.
- Updated the target seed loader and VM root initialization to resolve globals and roots from those image-provided tables instead of C-implied header layout.
- Updated the host-side inspector and tests to decode and validate the new seed format.
- Verified with `PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v`, `make -C platform/qemu-riscv64 clean all`, and `make -C platform/qemu-riscv64 inspect-image`.

## 2026-03-06 - Seeded Transcript Layout
- Added a seeded transcript-layout object so text margins, line spacing, and pixel scale come from image data instead of fixed constants in `vm.c`.
- Updated the VM text-rendering path to resolve cursor origin, wrapping, and scaling from that seeded layout root without changing the target message surface.
- Updated seed generation, inspection, and manifest tests to cover the new layout root and shifted object indices.
- Verified with `PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v`, `make -C platform/qemu-riscv64 clean all`, and `make -C platform/qemu-riscv64 inspect-image`.

## 2026-03-06 - Seeded Transcript Colors
- Added a seeded transcript-style object so default foreground and background colors come from the boot image instead of fixed constants in `vm.c`.
- Widened seed field payloads to 32-bit values so the seed can carry full color integers directly without special encoding.
- Updated the VM bootstrap, seed loader, image inspector, and manifest tests to cover the new style root and shifted seed object indices.
- Verified with `PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v`, `make -C platform/qemu-riscv64 clean all`, and `make -C platform/qemu-riscv64 inspect-image`.

## 2026-03-06 - Seeded Transcript Metrics
- Added a seeded transcript-metrics object so transcript cursor advance and wrapping come from image data instead of hardcoded cell-size constants in `vm.c`.
- Updated the VM to resolve text cell width and height from that seeded root, leaving glyph bitmap assets and the runtime message surface unchanged.
- Bumped the seed version and updated the seed generator, loader, inspector, and manifest tests to cover the new metrics root.
- Verified with `PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v`, `make -C platform/qemu-riscv64 clean all`, and `make -C platform/qemu-riscv64 inspect-image`.

## 2026-03-06 - Seeded Transcript Behavior
- Replaced the raw fallback-glyph root with a seeded transcript-behavior object that carries fallback glyph selection and clear-on-overflow policy together.
- Updated the VM to derive fallback bitmap selection and overflow clearing from that seeded behavior object instead of keeping those policies implicit in `vm.c`.
- Bumped the seed version and updated the seed generator, loader, inspector, and manifest tests to cover the new behavior root and shifted seed object count.
- Verified with `PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v`, `make -C platform/qemu-riscv64 clean all`, and `make -C platform/qemu-riscv64 inspect-image`.

## 2026-03-06 - Seeded Built-In Class Descriptors
- Added explicit seeded class-descriptor objects and per-object class links for the built-in target objects so the boot image carries more of the kernel object/class structure directly.
- Reused the seed object header to carry class indices, updated the target seed loader and heap bootstrap to install those class links, and kept the runtime message surface unchanged.
- Extended the image inspector and tests to validate class links and report the number of seeded class descriptors.
- Verified with `PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v`, `make -C platform/qemu-riscv64 clean all`, and `make -C platform/qemu-riscv64 inspect-image`.

## 2026-03-06 - Boot-Time Class Graph Validation
- Made the seeded built-in class layer active at boot by validating that every seeded object has a class link, that class links point to class descriptors, and that each class descriptor's instance-kind field matches the object's runtime kind.
- Extended the host-side image inspector to validate the same class graph and report both class-descriptor count and total class-link count for the seed image.
- Added targeted manifest assertions for the first built-in object/class link and the class-class descriptor shape.
- Verified with `PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v`, `make -C platform/qemu-riscv64 clean all`, and `make -C platform/qemu-riscv64 inspect-image`.

## 2026-03-06 - Minimal Class Introspection
- Added the smallest runtime-facing use of the seeded class layer: heap objects now answer `class`, and class objects answer `instanceKind`.
- Updated the target lowerer and demo program to exercise that path, so the framebuffer output now proves class introspection works end to end on the MVP target.
- Fixed runtime allocation so newly created `Form` and `Bitmap` objects inherit the correct seeded class links instead of only the pre-seeded roots having valid class identity.
- Verified with `PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v`, `make -C platform/qemu-riscv64 clean all`, and `make -C platform/qemu-riscv64 inspect-image`.

## 2026-03-06 - Class-Based Primitive Routing
- Refactored target-side heap-object send dispatch to derive each receiver's primitive family from its seeded class descriptor instead of branching directly on raw object-kind tags.
- Kept the selector surface and behavior unchanged, so this is a runtime cleanup that makes the seeded class layer part of ordinary dispatch without attempting a full method lookup system.
- Applied the same class-based check to the `BitBlt fillForm:color:` operand validation path so newly allocated forms and pre-seeded forms are treated uniformly through class identity.
- Verified with `PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v`, `make -C platform/qemu-riscv64 clean all`, and `make -C platform/qemu-riscv64 inspect-image`.

## 2026-03-06 - Extracted Class-Based Primitive Helpers
- Split the `Form`, `Bitmap`, and `Class` primitive selector handling out of the monolithic heap-object send switch into dedicated helper routines in `vm.c`.
- Kept the runtime behavior and selector surface unchanged, but narrowed the main dispatch path so future primitive-family cleanup can proceed one class-shaped slice at a time.
- Verified with `PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v` and `make -C platform/qemu-riscv64 clean all inspect-image`.

## 2026-03-06 - Extracted Transcript And Display Helpers
- Split the `Transcript` and `Display` primitive selector handling out of the monolithic heap-object send switch into dedicated helper routines in `vm.c`.
- Kept the runtime behavior unchanged and left both classes routed through the same default-form services, but narrowed the dispatch path so more primitive families can be cleaned up independently.
- Verified with `PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v` and `make -C platform/qemu-riscv64 clean all inspect-image`.

## 2026-03-06 - Extracted BitBlt Helper
- Split the `BitBlt` primitive selector handling out of the monolithic heap-object send switch into a dedicated helper routine in `vm.c`.
- Kept the existing operand validation and copy/fill behavior unchanged, so this remains a structural cleanup that leaves the MVP graphics surface stable while shrinking the central dispatch path.
- Verified with `PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v` and `make -C platform/qemu-riscv64 clean all inspect-image`.

## 2026-03-06 - Extracted Glyph And Factory Helpers
- Split the remaining `Glyphs`, `FormFactory`, and `BitmapFactory` primitive selector handling out of the monolithic heap-object send switch into dedicated helper routines in `vm.c`.
- Kept allocation and glyph lookup behavior unchanged, leaving the heap-object send path as a narrow family dispatcher rather than a large inline selector switch.
- Verified with `PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v` and `make -C platform/qemu-riscv64 clean all inspect-image`.

## 2026-03-06 - Added Heap-Object Send Router
- Replaced the remaining inline heap-object family chain in `dispatch_send` with an explicit router layer driven by a small family-handler table.
- Kept the existing class-derived primitive kind logic and per-family behavior unchanged, but moved the VM one step closer to a tiny lookup-shaped runtime instead of a handcrafted send switch.
- Verified with `PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v` and `make -C platform/qemu-riscv64 clean all inspect-image`.

## 2026-03-06 - Added Target Panic Context Reporting
- Added a machine-level panic hook seam and used it from the target VM to print current phase, instruction, last send selector/operands, and a short value stack dump on VM panics.
- Kept the runtime behavior unchanged on the success path, but made target failures much more inspectable over serial without introducing a debugger protocol or widening the language surface.
- Added a failing QEMU example and a headless panic integration test that asserts the serial panic output includes the new VM context report.
- Verified with `PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v` and `make -C platform/qemu-riscv64 clean all inspect-image`.

## 2026-03-06 - Seeded Built-In Method Descriptors
- Extended the target seed/image format with a `MethodDescriptor` object kind and two extra class-descriptor fields so each seeded built-in class now owns an explicit contiguous range of built-in method descriptors.
- Kept execution primitive-based for now, but added matching VM boot validation and host-side image inspection so the target image carries a real class-to-method layer instead of only class links plus ad hoc primitive families.
- Updated the manifest tests and inspector summary to cover the new method-descriptor counts and reject malformed method metadata.
- Verified with `PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v` and `make -C platform/qemu-riscv64 clean all inspect-image`.

## 2026-03-06 - Routed Sends Through Seeded Method Lookup
- Changed target heap-object sends to scan the receiver class's seeded built-in method descriptors first, then route the matched send through the existing primitive-family handlers.
- Kept execution primitive-based after lookup, but made the seeded method layer runtime-active instead of boot-only metadata, which is the first real step toward lookup-shaped execution.
- Added a headless QEMU integration case using a `.rz` example file to prove that a supported selector sent to the wrong receiver now fails through class lookup with a targeted panic.
- Verified with `PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v` and `make -C platform/qemu-riscv64 clean all inspect-image`.

## 2026-03-06 - Dispatched Through Method Entry Ids
- Extended seeded built-in method descriptors with an explicit entry id and bumped the target seed format so method lookup now resolves to a concrete execution entry instead of only a primitive family.
- Replaced the heap-object family router with a method-entry handler table in `vm.c`, while keeping execution primitive-backed and validating selector, arity, and receiver kind against the declared entry metadata at boot.
- Extended the host-side image inspector and manifest tests to validate method-entry metadata, report the number of unique seeded method entries, and reject entry/selector mismatches.
- Verified with `PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v` and `make -C platform/qemu-riscv64 clean all inspect-image`.

## 2026-03-06 - Seeded Method Entry Objects
- Added a new seeded `MethodEntry` object kind so built-in method descriptors now point to first-class entry objects in the image instead of storing raw execution ids directly.
- Kept execution handler behavior unchanged, but updated the target VM to fetch and validate the `MethodEntry` object before dispatch, which makes the kernel image more method-shaped without widening the language surface.
- Bumped the seed format again, increased the tiny target heap to fit the extra seeded objects, and extended the host-side inspector and manifest tests to validate and report `MethodEntry` objects alongside method descriptors.
- Verified with `PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v` and `make -C platform/qemu-riscv64 clean all inspect-image`.

## 2026-03-06 - Seeded Selector Objects
- Added a new seeded `Selector` object kind so built-in method descriptors now point to selector objects instead of carrying raw selector integers directly.
- Kept send bytecodes and runtime behavior unchanged, but updated the target VM and host-side inspector to resolve and validate selector objects as part of method lookup and boot-image checking.
- Bumped the seed format again, increased the tiny target heap to absorb the extra selector objects, and extended the manifest tests and inspector summary to cover selector-object counts and the shifted seed layout.
- Verified with `PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v` and `make -C platform/qemu-riscv64 clean all inspect-image`.

## 2026-03-06 - Activated Selector Objects In Lookup
- Made the seeded selector objects runtime-active by adding a selector-handle cache at boot and resolving object sends through selector-object identity during method lookup instead of comparing raw selector integers.
- Kept the language surface and successful send behavior unchanged, but aligned the runtime more closely with the image-owned selector layer and added host-side duplicate-selector validation to match the target cache assumptions.
- Added a focused inspector regression for duplicate selector objects and kept the QEMU boot/render path green with the new lookup seam.
- Verified with `PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v` and `make -C platform/qemu-riscv64 clean all inspect-image`.

## 2026-03-06 - Seeded Accessor Method Bodies
- Added a new seeded `AccessorMethod` object kind so a small set of trivial built-in methods can execute through image-owned method-body objects instead of only through C-side primitive handler entries.
- Moved `Bitmap>>width`, `Bitmap>>height`, `Form>>bits`, and `Class>>instanceKind` onto this accessor-method path, while keeping the rest of the built-in method table primitive-backed and preserving the existing runtime behavior.
- Extended the target VM, seed loader, host-side image inspector, and manifest tests to validate `MethodEntry` implementation objects, report accessor-method counts, and reject malformed accessor-backed entries.
- Verified with `PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v` and `make -C platform/qemu-riscv64 clean all inspect-image`.

## 2026-03-06 - Seeded Field-Send Method Bodies
- Added a new seeded `FieldSendMethod` object kind so the target kernel image can represent a slightly richer built-in method body than a direct slot read while still staying entirely inside the current built-in method-entry model.
- Moved `Form>>width` and `Form>>height` off the primitive handler table and onto this field-send path, where the method body reads `bits` from the receiver and then sends `width` or `height` to that bitmap value through the ordinary send machinery.
- Refactored the target VM’s send core just enough to support nested value sends from method-body objects, and extended the seed/image inspector plus manifest tests to validate and report the new `FieldSendMethod` objects.
- Verified with `PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v` and `make -C platform/qemu-riscv64 clean all inspect-image`.

## 2026-03-06 - Seeded Root-Send Method Bodies
- Added a new seeded `RootSendMethod` object kind so the kernel image can represent zero-argument methods that delegate to a seeded root object and then choose whether to return the nested result or the original receiver.
- Moved `Transcript>>cr`, `Display>>clear`, and `Display>>newline` off the primitive handler table and onto this root-send path, with each method now delegating to the seeded default form through the same send machinery used by ordinary lookup.
- Extended target-side boot validation and the host-side image inspector to validate root ids, delegated selectors, and return modes for `RootSendMethod` objects, and updated the manifest tests to cover the shifted seed layout and the new object counts.
- Verified with `PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v` and `make -C platform/qemu-riscv64 clean all inspect-image`.

## 2026-03-06 - Forwarded One-Argument Root Sends
- Extended the existing seeded `RootSendMethod` execution path so it can forward the caller's arguments unchanged into its delegated send instead of only supporting zero-argument delegation.
- Moved `Transcript>>show:` and `Display>>writeString:` off the primitive handler table and onto that forwarded root-send path, with both methods now delegating to `writeString:` on the seeded default form and returning the original receiver.
- Kept the seed schema unchanged, but increased the number of seeded `RootSendMethod` objects, updated the manifest expectations to match the shifted method-entry layout, and removed the now-dead default-form helper from `vm.c`.
- Verified with `PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v` and `make -C platform/qemu-riscv64 clean all inspect-image`.

## 2026-03-06 - Seeded Root-Value Method Bodies
- Added a new seeded `RootValueMethod` object kind so the kernel image can represent methods that simply answer one of the seeded root objects without falling back to a primitive handler.
- Moved `Display>>defaultForm` off the primitive table and onto that root-value path, which completes the current `Display` family as image-owned method bodies rather than C-only entry handlers.
- Extended target-side boot validation and the host-side image inspector to validate `RootValueMethod` objects and method-entry links, updated the manifest tests for the shifted seed layout and new object counts, and removed the now-dead `form_value` helper from `vm.c`.
- Verified with `PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v` and `make -C platform/qemu-riscv64 clean all inspect-image`.

## 2026-03-06 - Seeded Interpreted Display Methods
- Added a new seeded `InterpretedMethod` object kind so the target kernel image can carry its first generic interpreted built-in method bodies instead of only specialized method-body descriptors.
- Moved `Display>>defaultForm`, `Display>>clear`, `Display>>writeString:`, and `Display>>newline` onto that interpreted path, using a tiny fixed instruction set with `pushRoot`, `pushArgument`, `send`, `returnTop`, and `returnReceiver`.
- Updated target-side seed validation, runtime execution, the host-side image inspector, and the manifest tests to validate and report interpreted method objects in the shifted seed layout.
- Verified with `PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v` and `make -C platform/qemu-riscv64 clean all inspect-image`.
